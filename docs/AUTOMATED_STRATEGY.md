# Developing Automated Strategy

**Problem 2**: During an offseason competition, we felt the speed at which we were able to select teams during alliance selection as well as generate match strategy was incredibly slow because of the number of factors needed to be considered for smart strategies.

**Solution 2**: We started developing automated strategy tools which can determine "mini-factors" in match and alliance strategy. These mini-factors can then be further automated for complete match strategy generated by the system. Examples include ...

 - Defense
     - Determining if a defense bot is needed
     - If so, which robot is best suited
     - If a certain bot should have defense played against it because of its mechanical features from pit scouting
 - Auto
     - Using pit scouting information, what teams have preference in auto selection
 - Alliance Selection
     - Chance of an alliance picking a robot
     - Alliance Simulation over time to see 
     - Determining the optimal alliance based on
         - preference of defense or offense
         - Best alliance to win in order of qf, sf, f
