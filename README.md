# FalconVis

FalconVis is a powerful data visualization and strategy generation platform built for FRC teams. The system can take in JSON files (hosted or local), parse the data, generate dynamic/editable visualizations, and develop match and alliance selection strategies on the fly. The system is built on top of data generated by [FalconScout](https://github.com/Team4099/FalconScout), Team 4099's scouting app.
